The NB-IOT base station SDR receiver project involves designing an FIR digital filter for an NB-IOT software-defined radio (SDR) base station receiver. The project includes generating standard-compliant NB-IOT uplink complex baseband waveforms, simulating 8 NB-IOT devices transmitting their UL signal, and implementing a digital FIR filter in the IF stage of the receiver. The filter must select the desired NB-IOT signal, allowing for down sampling. Design specifications and constraints, including pass band ripples, stop band attenuation, transition region width, and filter complexity, must be determined. The design process involves multiple iterations and evaluation against quantitative criteria. The project concludes with the presentation of FIR filter coefficients, frequency response, and justification based on the iterative design process. Evaluation includes plotting spectra at various stages of signal processing.
